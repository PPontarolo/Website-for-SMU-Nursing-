This was my Senoir Project with 3 other teammates </br>
orignal link is https://github.com/agalfred/Senior-Project </br>
</br>
The project was to make a Website for our school nursing program. The website would keep track of the departments inventory and would notify the Admin when there is a shortage. the website needed to be accessed on any device and only be accessed locally in the department.
